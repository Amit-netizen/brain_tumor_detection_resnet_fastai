This repository implements a deep learning solution for brain tumor detection in MRI images using ResNet-based architectures and the FastAI library. The project leverages transfer learning to accurately classify MRI scans, distinguishing between images with and without tumors. It provides a complete workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üéØ Project Goals

* **Accurate Brain Tumor Detection:** Develop a high-accuracy model for binary classification of brain MRI images (tumor vs. no tumor).
* **Efficient Training with FastAI:** Utilize FastAI's high-level API to streamline model training, validation, and inference.
* **Model Evaluation and Interpretation:** Thoroughly evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and visualize results for better understanding.
* **Reproducible Research:** Provide a well-organized and documented Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility and further experimentation.

## üî¨ Methodology

The core methodology involves:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading MRI image data and preparing it for model training using FastAI's `ImageDataLoaders`.
2.  **Transfer Learning with ResNet:** Fine-tuning pre-trained ResNet architectures (specifically, ResNet18 in the provided notebook) on the brain MRI dataset. Transfer learning significantly accelerates training and improves performance by leveraging knowledge learned from large datasets like ImageNet.
3.  **Model Training with FastAI:** Utilizing FastAI's `Learner` class to train the model, including techniques like learning rate finding and optimization.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5.  **Visualization:** Visualizing the model's predictions and performance through confusion matrices.

## üìä Key Results

The notebook demonstrates excellent results, achieving near-perfect accuracy on the validation set.

* **Accuracy:** The model achieved approximately 100% accuracy on the validation set in the provided notebook run.

**Note:** While the initial README provided results for different ResNet architectures, the current notebook primarily focuses on ResNet18. The high accuracy achieved suggests the dataset might be relatively simple, or the model has learned the patterns very effectively. Further investigation with a more diverse and challenging dataset is recommended for real-world applications.
