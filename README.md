Brain tumor detection using ResNet-based architectures (ResNet-18/34/50/101/152, WRN, ResNeXt-50/101) with FastAI.  
Achieved up to **99% accuracy (ResNet-50)**, **98.21% precision (ResNet-34)**, and **97.51% F1-score (ResNeXt-101)**.  
Includes benchmarking, optimization, and evaluation of deep learning models.
