This repository contains a deep learning solution for brain tumor detection using ResNet-based architectures and the FastAI library. The project focuses on leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image analysis to accurately classify brain MRI images. It includes code for model training, evaluation, and inference, along with detailed analysis and benchmarking.

## üéØ Project Goals

* **Accurate Brain Tumor Detection:** To develop a robust and accurate model for identifying the presence of brain tumors in MRI images.
* **Performance Evaluation:** To systematically evaluate and compare the performance of various ResNet architectures (ResNet-18/34/50/101/152, Wide ResNet (WRN), ResNeXt-50/101).
* **FastAI Integration:** To utilize the FastAI library for efficient training, validation, and deployment of deep learning models.
* **Code Reproducibility:** To provide well-documented code and Jupyter notebooks for easy reproducibility and further research.

## üî¨ Methodology

This project employs transfer learning, a technique that leverages pre-trained models on large datasets (like ImageNet) to solve similar but smaller tasks.  Specifically, we fine-tune ResNet-based architectures on a dataset of brain MRI images. FastAI simplifies the process of training these models, handling many best practices like learning rate finding, differential learning rates, and data augmentation.

## üìä Key Results

The project achieved high performance in brain tumor detection. Here's a summary of the results for some key models:

| Model         | Accuracy | Precision | F1-Score |
|---------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| ResNet-50     | 99.00%   | 97.88%    | 98.10%   |
| ResNet-34     | 94.05%   | 98.21%    | 96.00%   |
| ResNeXt-101   | 95.04%   | 97.30%    | 97.51%   |

**Observations:**

* **High Accuracy:** ResNet-50 demonstrated excellent accuracy (99.00%), indicating the model's ability to correctly classify MRI images.
* **Precision and F1-Score Trade-off:** Different architectures exhibit varying trade-offs between precision and F1-score. ResNet-34 achieved the highest precision (98.21%), minimizing false positives, while ResNeXt-101 showed a strong balance between precision and recall, resulting in a high F1-score (97.51%).
